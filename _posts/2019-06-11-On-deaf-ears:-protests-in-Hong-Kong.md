On Sunday huge numbers of protesters took to the humid streets of Hong Kong (police estimated 240,000; organisers counted 1m) to demonstrate against a bill that would allow the rendition of suspected criminals to mainland China. The mass show of discontent has not swayed the government. Carrie Lam, Hong Kongâ€™s chief executive, refuses to bow to demands that she step down and has reiterated her commitment to the bill. Her promise to closely monitor the extradition process did not appease those worried that China will use the law to snag dissidents as well as criminals. Further protests are planned for Wednesday, when the bill goes before lawmakers, but police may keep activists away. Calls for a general strike will not appeal to workaholic Hong Kongers, though some shops say they will close. But as long as Beijing demands that the extradition law be changed, Hong Kong may have little choice.
